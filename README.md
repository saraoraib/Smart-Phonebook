# Smart-Phonebook

The Smart Phonebook is a simple yet efficient phonebook management system that allows users to search for phone numbers, search by name, and add new contacts to a digital phonebook. This project is designed to help students practice working with dictionaries, loops, conditional statements, and basic input validation.

The system provides an interactive menu for users to perform the following actions:

Search by Phone Number: Users can input a phone number to search for the owner's name.

Search by Name: Users can search for a phone number by entering a person's name.

Add New Contact: Users can add new contacts by providing a name and phone number.

Exit: Exits the program.
